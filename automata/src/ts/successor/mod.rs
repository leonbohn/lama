/// Encapsulates the transition function Î´ of a (finite) transition system. This is the main trait that
/// is used to query a transition system. Transitions are labeled with a [`Alphabet::Expression`], which
/// determines on which [`Alphabet::Symbol`]s the transition can be taken. Additionally, every transition
/// is labeled with a [`Color`], which can be used to store additional information about it, like an
/// associated priority.
///
/// # The difference between [`Transition`]s and [`crate::ts::Edge`]s
/// Internally, a transition system is represented as a graph, where the states are the nodes and the
/// transitions are the edges. However, the [`Transition`]s are not the same as the [`crate::ts::Edge`]s.
/// Both store the source and target vertex as well as the color, however an [`crate::ts::Edge`] is labelled
/// with an expression, while a [`Transition`] is labelled with an actual symbol (that [`Alphabet::matches`]
/// the expression). So a transition is a concrete edge that is taken (usually by the run on a word), while
/// an edge may represent any different number of transitions.
